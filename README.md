# Example of using nats-py

My 2 brain cells didn't get the official manual. So I needed a better example of Nats usage in python, but there wasn't one. After an hour (0_o) I came up with this code, which in my opinion is much better to read and see how nats really works.

Code was run on python 3.10.4

```
pyenv install 3.10.4
pyenv shell 3.10.4

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing natspy you can just casually run receiver and publisher in separate terminals.
